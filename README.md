This is a simple test at using the DartVM runtime embedding API to script properties in a cinder app.  To build, clone or symlink cinder to './cinder'.  Dart binaries are included for Mac OS X / i386.

Not much info on the runtime API yet but here is link the source:

http://dart.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dart/runtime/include/dart_api.h
